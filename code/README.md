The simulate and recover excercise based on the EZ Diffusion Model simulated data and recovered the model parameters (drift rate, boundary seperation, and nondecision time). This process was execued through breaking the task into three core components: the forward equations, the inverse equations, and the simulation of data. The forward equations focused on generating predicting summary statistics (accuracy rate, mean RT, and variance of RT) based on the parameters, while the inverse equations allowed for the recovery of these parameters from observed summary statistics. 
One of the key goals of this project was ensuring the simulated data reflectived realistic models. For this, I generated random values for the aprameters within reasonable ranges and ran the simulation multiple times across different sample sizes (N=10, N=40, N=4000). I implemented the inverse equations to recover the paramters; I took into account edge cases such as how the observed accuracy Rate, Robs, is near 0.5, which was causing me logarithmic errors. To address this, I used a clipping mechanism to ensure Robs stayed within a valid range. 
Another key goal of this exercise was running simulations across multiple sample sizes to observe how parameter recovery varied with the amount of data. Smaller sample sizes typically introduced more noise, making parameter recovery less accurate; Larger sample sizes led to more precise estimates. The program simulated data by drawing from distributions: accuracy rate from a binomial distribution and mean and variance of Rt from normal and gama distributions. In the inverse function, I used the absolute value of Robs in the calculation of y to avoid errors when RObs was close to 0.5
My code was structured into modular files. The forward.py file contained the forward EZ equations, inverse.py included the inverse equations for parameter recovery, and simulate.py simulated the data. This allowed for targeted testing of individual components using the unittest framework in Python. I added test cases to check the accuracy and robustness of both the forward and inverse models. The inverse model included error handling, especially for situations where the discriminant was negative, as well. 
The pipeline was automated with bash scripts. The main.sh script ran the full simulation and recovery process 3000 times for each sample size, saving the results in CSV files for further analysis. THe test.sh script ran the unit tests to verify correctness of functions. 
The results of the simulate-and-recover exercise showed that the EZ Diffusion Model can accurately recover the model parameters when the data are generated according to the model. The bias between the true and estimated parameters was small and approached zero as the sample size increased. Additionally, the squared error decreased with larger sample sizes, demonstrating that the recovery process becomes more accurate with more data. 
## For this project I referenced ChatGPT and UCI ZotGPT.
